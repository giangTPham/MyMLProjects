# MyMLProjects
This is the compilation all (or most) of the Machine Learning Projects I have done when I was in University. It contains the introduction to the problem, documents, and code.

## List of Projects

| Project's name | Link |
|---|---|
| Text Classification with 20NewsGroup | [20NewsGroup](./20NewsGroupClassification/) |
| Brain Tumor Segmentation | [BrainTumorSeg](./BrainTumorSegmentation/) |

*The list will continue to be updated in the future*

## Recommended resources to start Deep Learning Path

| What? | Resource |
|---|---|
| Basic Machine Learning | [link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) |
| Deep Learning Specialization | [link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) |
| Paper With Code | [link](https://paperswithcode.com/) |
| Model Zoo | [link](https://modelzoo.co/) |

If you want to learn Machine Learning from Basics, you may want to take Basic Machine Learning course. Else, it is totally possible to jump right into Deep Learning Specialization. The later links are source code and paper for different deep learning models and architectures.
