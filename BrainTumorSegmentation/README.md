# Brain Tumor Detection

## Project Description:

Our project belongs to *Object Detection* class of problem. *Object Detection* is a combination of *Segmentation* and *Classification*. *Segmentation*, according to [this article](https://viso.ai/deep-learning/image-segmentation-using-deep-learning/#:~:text=Image%20segmentation%20is%20the%20task,into%20multiple%20segments%20or%20objects.) is the task of clustering parts of an image together that belong to the same object class. This process is also called pixel-level classification. In other words, it involves partitioning images (or video frames) into multiple segments or objects. "Classification" is to classify an input into a given categories. So *Object Detection* is to cluster parts of an image and put it into one or more categories.

Our task's purpose is to segment part of a medical image and classify it into 1 of 3 categories: meningioma, glioma, pituitary tumor. You can find details about the dataset in this [link](https://github.com/guillaumefrd/brain-tumor-mri-dataset).

Our approach makes use of a popular model for image segmentation called **Unet**, several explanations of Unet's architecture and purpose can be found online.
